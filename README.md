Author: Alberto Mezzo

## Scope of Work

Mark each of the requirements you completed by adding an X in between the square brackets. If you have any comments for a given section, add them in the "Comments from student" section (i.e. I almost finished this, but 3 tests aren't passing).

| Requirement                                                       | Completed? | Comments from student |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1. File path via CLI                                              | [X]        |                       |
| 2. tokens.txt file updated and files regenerated; `Lexer` updated | [X]        |                       |
| 3. `Token` class updated                                          | [X]        |                       |
| 4. `Lexer` token output updated                                   | [X]        |Output is displayed correctly (based on simple.x), but some autograder tests are failing|
| 5. `Lexer` source file output added                               | [X]        |Output is displayed correctly (based on simple.x), but some autograder tests are failing|

## Results and Conclusions

### What I Learned

By completing this assignment, I learned a lot about the structure and logic of complex programs like the Lexer. I gained valuable insights into debugging and managing various methods and files. Overall, it can be said that it was not easy, and although I did not perform exceptionally well, I learned much more than I expected.

### Challenges I Encountered

By completing this assignment, I faced new challenges. At first, it was difficult to understand the entire logic of the Lexer and the structure of the Repository. Later, I learned how to implement BinaryLit and correctly print data directly from the filename.x file. I am still trying to fix and understand how to solve many problems related to the autograder, adjusting my code accordingly to make it as solid as possible.
